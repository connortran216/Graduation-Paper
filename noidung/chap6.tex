\chapter{Implementation details}
\noindent

	In this research, we take advantage of a pre-trained model of Mask R-CNN and fine-tune it to for our problem instead of training the whole architecture of Mask R-CNN from scratch due to the lack of time and resources. Although Facebook's researchers published the official source code in 2018, we prefer using the unofficial one from Matterport Inc which was published in 2017 due to the majority of deep learning practitioner community (5k3 fork times compared to 9k6 ones, respectively). You can access it via this link \url{https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN}.
